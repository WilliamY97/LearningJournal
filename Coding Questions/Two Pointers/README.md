# Two Pointers

Two pointer questions can be seperated into three categories with subcategories:

### 1. Meeting (Sum or Array)
### 2. Forwarding (List, Tail, Window, or Fast&Slow)
### 3. Two Arrays

## Meeting

### Sum Subcategory

**167. Two Sum II - Input Array is Sorted**

Use two pointers left and right of the array and increment/decrement them if the sum of the values between them is greater or smaller than
the expected target. If the sum is the target then return it. Left pointer should be always smaller than right pointer. If they cross then
the algo is finished and return [] because no values add up to target.
