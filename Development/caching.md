# Caching
Is a component that transparently stores data so that future requests of that data can be served faster.

**tldr;** Caching is done by some component (ex. beaker) to store data so that requestso of the same data can be server again quicker

Caching can reduce the server load by storing the results of common operations and serving the precomputed answers to clients
