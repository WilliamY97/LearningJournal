#Sharding

- Sharding is a kind of database partitioning that turns very large databases into data shards which are smaller, faster, and more easily managed.

- These shards can then be spread amongst multiple servers

- As the size of a database and the number of transactions increases per unit of time linearly - the response time for querying the
database increases exponentially
