#SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)

## What is SSL?

- SSL is a standard security technology for establishing an encrypted link between a server and client - typically a webserver (website)
and a browser; or a mail server and a mail client (e.g. Outlook)

- SSL allows sensitive information such as credit card numbers, social security numbers, and login credentials to be transmitted securely. Normally, data sent between browsers and web servers is sent in plain textâ€”leaving you vulnerable to eavesdropping. If an attacker is able to intercept all data being sent between a browser and a web server they can see and use that information.

- SSL is a security protocol. Protocols describe how algorithms should be used; in this case, the SSL protocol determines variables of the encryption for both the link and the data being transmitted.
