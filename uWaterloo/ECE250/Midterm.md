##Midterm

- Find big O notation for snippets of code and then prove the run time with definition.

##Lowerbound

- Minimum time required to execute

##Overall Definitions
- Find c, n, etc

##Methods for Solving Recurrences

- If it doesn't ask which technique to apply - use any method you like.

- Master Method: May not be applicable to every reoccurence function

- Repeated Substitution

- Recursion-Tree Method

##Elementary Data Structures
- A stack is a container of objects that are inserted and removed according to the **last-in-first-out** (LIFO) principle)

- A queue differs from a stack in that its insertion and removal routines follows the first-in-first-out (FIFO) principle.
 
##Hashing

- Collision Resolution: Chaining, Open Addressing (Linear Probing, Double Hashing)

##Trees

- Binary Search Trees (BST)

- AVL Trees

- B-Trees

##Preperation for the Exam

- **First**, concentrate on the lecture notes
- **Second**, studying the CLRS/Weiss books wherever are needed (although you have to know the concepts!)
- **Third**, solving exercises by yourself
> When solving write your solutions down!
