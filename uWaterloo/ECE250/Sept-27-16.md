#Hash Tables (Part B)

##More On Collisions

- A key is mapped to an already occupied table location... what to do???

- Use a collision handling technique: 

A) Chaining 

B) Open Addressing
- Probing

##Open Addressing

- All elements are stored in the hash table (n <= m)

- Insertion systematically probes the table until an empty slot is found -> the table may fill up!

- Modify hash function to take the probe number i as the second parameter (depends on both the key
and the probe number)

##Double Hashing

- h(k,i) + (h(k) + i) mod m

- k: key  m:  size of hash table  i: # of collision
