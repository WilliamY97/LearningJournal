##  Synopsis:
There exist a number of prescription drugs called nootropics, which are intended to improve concentration, fo-cus, and general cognitive (brain) function. These have legitimate medical uses as treatments for conditions likenarcolepsy. In recent years, students have been acquiring these medications without a prescription, not to treatany condition, but in the hopes of improving studying, assignment, and test-taking performance. The term “studydrugs” is sometimes used to refer to the various medications in question.Is the use of study drugs (without a diagnosis and appropriate prescription) ethical? Your answer should reference **the values in the compass discussed in lectures. You should also evaluate this question using at least one of the ethical theories discussed in the lectures**. It is permitted to use ethical theories not discussed in class to evaluatethis question. Please note that nothing will be read into your answer; you need not personally believe the position you choose to support in your essay and neither markers nor anyone else will make any assumptions.

## Lecture 30 - Ethics: Introduction

- Ethics sare about moral principles; about how we know what is "right" and what is "wrong"

- Instead of starting with a long discussion of the subject - let's look at an exercise where we examine ethical situations.

- In all of them, we must make a decision.

## The Runaway Train Car, Scenario 1

In the first example, our decision is binary:
A. Do nothing B. Pull the lever

1A: There are five workers on the current line and one on the parallel track. What do you do?

1B: What if there are only two workers on the main line?

1C: What if there are 50 workers? etc. etc.

Also an example from a car crash where one person may be sacrificed to save five severely injured people.

## Professional Engineering Ethics

- The definition of professional misconduct includes those behaviours that a professional engineer in Ontario must not engage in.

- These define an absolute line which must not be crossed.

- Note that one can be guilty of professional misconduct even if there are no negative consequences.

- In general, however, complaints are a result of an action or behaviour having a negative consequence.

## Big Questions

- Should we regulate how professional engineers interact with other professionals?
- Should P. Eng.'s exaggerate their abilities or the abilities of the profession?
- Should professional engineers malign the character of others in the profession?
- You find that your designs had a flaw due to an unknown effect not anticipated in normal engineering practce: is
sufficient to fix the mistake but not tell anyone about it?
- Is it right to take credit for the work done by your subordinates and co-op students working under you?

## Morals

- A moral, meaning a custom or a habit is an action, behaviour, character trait or desire that has been determined to be:
1. Right or wrong
2. Good or bad
3. Saintly or evil
4. Honourable or dishonourable
5. Brave or cowardly

- It is based on a general consensus of society. They are not based in law or regulations; there are immoral rules and immoral orders.

## Ethics

- The study of ethics or moral philosophy is the study of human interactions.
- It is for determining or recommending whether an actions, behaviours, conduct, or desires is right or wrong, including:
ex. actions, behaviours, characteristics, desires

- There are two general definitions of ethics.

1. A collection or system of moral principles or rules of conduct by which a person or association is guided.
2. The science of morals; the department of study concerned with the principles of human duty.

## Hippocratic Oath

- The Hippocratic Oath and Professional Engineers Ontario Code of Ethics are two examples of collections of rules of conduct
- In many jurisdictions, a code of ethics defines the boundary between professional conduct and misconduct.

- We will see later, that PEO's Code of Ethics provide a guide to conduct while, as we've seen, misconduct is explicitly
defined in the regulations.

## Ethics: The Science of Morals

Ethics is itself broken into numerous categories:

- **Meta-ethics:** The theoretical inquiry of moral principles and how their truth values (if any) may be determined.
- **Normative Ethics:** Concerning the practical means of determining a moral course of action.
- **Applied Ethics:** Situation-based moral outcomes
- **Descriptive Ethics:** The study of extant ethical behaviour and comparative analysis
- **Moral Psychology:** The scientific study of the development and evolution of ethical behaviour

## Normative Ethics

We will focus entirely on normative ethics:

- Concerning the practical means of determining a moral course of action
- Normative ethics tends to be prescriptive: it prescribes how to deal with a particular ethical situation
- Descriptive ethics is empirical: it investigates a society's response in dealing with a particular ethical situation

## Virtue Ethics

- Asks how a response to a situation will affect the percieved character of the person
- Helping a person in need would be charitable, and viewed positively.
- A decision on whether or not to lie would be judged on how that falsehood reflects on the individual's character
- First discussed in western philosophy by Plato and then Aristotle.
- Plato lists four cardinal moral virtues: courage, temperance, justice, prudence.
- Each is the golden mean between two extremes.

## Role Ethics

- Morality is derived from people's relationship with their community and is not individualistic.

- Confucianism demonstrates this through the concept of filial piety as a desire and not only as an action

"In serving his parents, a filial son reveres them in daily life; he makes them happy while he nourishes them;
he takes anxious care of them in sickeness; he shows great sorrow over their death; and he sacrifices to them with solemnity"


## Lecture 31 - Ethics: Modern Ethical Theories

## Agree to Disagree

- In this course you will be exposed to different ethical theories and different points of view. So far we have already seen
the opinions of others...

- You may agree with some of the theories under discussion, disagree with others...

- You may nevertheless be required to answer questions based on these theories, regardless of your personal beliefs

- This is not a natural science where there are correct answers ("the world is round, not flat"); reasonable people
can agree to disagree civilly.

## With Support

- Therefore, we must understand that you know how to make an ethical decision by making a reason decision based on underlying assumptions.

- Your opinion in class is invaluable - it will make for fascinating discussions.

- Your opinion on an examination, without a logical support, is worth nothing.

- "Because I said so" -type argumens and "I feel like this is true" are not adequate reasoons to support the assertions

## Deontology

- The science of duty; the branch of knowledge that deals with moral obligations; ethics.

- Deontology determines the morality of an action, behaviour, character, or desire based on its adherence to a rule or rules.

- It is also known as duty-based ethics.

- Deontology was the first modern ethical theory.

- It is based heavily on concepts such as moral absolutism and divine command theory

- It posts that there are rules or duties that must be followed and that by fulfilling one's duties or following these
rules one is ethical.

- Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) argued an action is good only if it is the consequence of duty as opposed to desire or need.

- He also argued that good intentions, rather than good outcomes, are what make an act moral.

- After all, bad things may happen by accident, but intent is important.

- Kant saw a need for universal principles that guided human behaviour and conscience.

- This led him to introduce the idea of a **categorical imperative**

## Deontology Cont.
- An action can only be moral if it is a consequence of following a categorical imperative (i.e, a universally applicable principle)

1. It is performed out of a sense of moral duty.
2. Any maxim in harmony with the categorical imperative must be universally applicable to all beings with free will.
3. All actions that are performed according to a maxim that cannot be applied universally do not have moral worth.

Kant formulated three maxims:

1. Act only on the maxim whereby thou canst at the same time will that it should become a universal law.

2. So act as to treat humanity, whether in thine own person or in that of any other, in every case as an end withal, never as means only.

3. A rational being must always regard himself as giving laws either as member or as sovereign in a kingdom of ends which is rendered possible by the freedom of will.

One possible way that this duty based morality can be abused is "I was only following orders"

## Deontology Cont. 2

Deontology has continued to evolve as a theory of normative ethics

Frances Kamm of Harvard continues to use this approach

## Necessity and Sufficiency

A little formal logic for you

A condition a is sufficient for z if a -> z.

But it is also possible that b -> z, c -> z

Example: Event z is you have enough money to go the concert

This could be caused by:

Your parents giving you money (a)
You find money on the street (b)
You win the lottery (c)
etc.

There is also the contrapositive !z -> !a and !b and !c

If you don't have the money, you didn't get it from your parents, or find it on the street, or win the lottery, or...

**Example 2**

A condition a is necessary for z if !a -> !z

But it is also possible that !b -> !z ... !a or !b or !c ... -> !z

Consider getting your engineering license as z.

All of these elements are necessary:

1. Engineering education (a)
2. Work Experiecne (b)
3. Completion of the PPE (c)

The absence of any one of those necessary elements means the license will not be granted.

The contrapositive: z -> a and b and c

If both a -> z and !a -> !z then it follows that z -> a and we say a is necessary and sufficient for z

We can also say a if and only if z (or a iff b).

## Frances Kamm

- Frances Kamm introduced the The Principle of Permissable Harm.

- One may harm in order to save more if and only if the harm is an effect or an aspect of the greater good itself.

- Evil is contrasted with wrong or harm as the involvement of persons without their consent when forseeably this will lead to
a wrong or harm to them.

**The Doctrine of Productive Purity**

1. If an evil cannot be at least initially sufficiently justified, it cannot be justified by the greater good that it is necessary (given our act) to causally produce. However, such an evil can be justified by the greater good whose component(s) cause it, even if the evil is causally necessary to help sustain the greater good or its components.

2. In order for an act to be permissible, it should be possible for any evil side effect (except possibly indirect side effects) of what we do, or evil causal means that we must use (given our act) to bring about the greater good, to be at least the effect of a [greater good that] is working itself out (or the effect of means that are noncausally related to that greater good that is working itself out).

## Consequentialism

- After Immanuel Kant described his ethical philosophies, others began using a different approach: they focused on the consequences of the action.

- It is the consequences that will form the basis of any judgement about the ethical correctness of the action.

- A morally right act or omission is one that has good consequences.

- Such ethical theories are **consequentialist** or **teleological**.

How do we define consequences?

- The same outcome may be viewed as positive by one person and negative by another.

- There may be vastly different short and long term consequences...

## State Consequentialism

- Consider Mozi, a Chinese philosopher from the 5th century BCE

He introduced the idea of state consequentialism:

"It is the business of the benevolent man to seek to promote what is beneficial to the world and to eliminate what is harmful, and to provide a model for the world. What benefits he will carry out; what does not benefit men he will leave alone"

## Utilitarianism

More recently, Jeremy Bentham (1748-1832) introduced the concept of **utilitarianism**.

- We must develop a measure of the **utility** of the consequences of an action.

- A means of quantitatively, or at least qualitatively, determining whether consequences are "good" (and which courses of action are better).

- He advocated for animal rights, gender equality, and acceptance of homosexuality (all ideas very much ahead of the times in which he lived)

## Math Problem

- Bentham introduced the concept of felicific calculus

The happiness of a consequence can be judged by:
1.Intensity
2.Duration
3.Certainty
4.Proximity
5.Fecundity
6.Purity
7.Extent

In simple terms, the greatest increase in good for the greatest number.

## Final Frontier

“The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.”

"Or the one."

## Incorrect Utilitarianism

One way that utilitarianism can be simplified, incorrectly, is the argument that “the ends justify the means”

## L32: Ethics: A Psychological Basis

## Ethics and Science

- Ethics used to be entirely in the domain of philosohy.

- Today, we have the ability to image the brain and apply neuroscience and other scientific study techniques.

- Ethics is slowly being moving from art to science.

Consider light:
*See slides for context*

## Ethics and Science Cont.
Values supporting it: care and loyalty to the family.

In some countries it would be a serious betrayal not to hire your relatives.
- Can we break ethics down into quantifiable items that can be measured?

- With functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) we can now begin to probe the human brain

- The human brain - not surprisingly - seems to be finite dimensional, as well.

- There is still much we do not understand about how the brain works, but research continues.

## Probing the Brain

- A part of the brain is associated with counting small numbers.

- In the intraparietal sulcus, different neurons will become excited if you view one, two, three, four or more subjects.

##  Ethics are Societal and Biological

Ethics is an evolved trait and depends on:
- Human species and the characteristics of the human species

Examples:

Shaking hands is reasonable, because little or no harm can come of it. Normal in Western Society; bowing is appropriate in Eastern
cultures

Contact with a stranger's face is unacceptable; too high a risk of damage. It takes trust to allow others to touch the face.

If humans had thicker skin, greater protection around the eyes, such contact might be acceptable/normal.

##  Ethics and Science Cont.

Drinking alcohol is not immoral and neither is driving. However a combination of them is.

Alcohol adversely affects human performance and that degradation can and will adversely affect others (e.g. car crash)

##  We are but mortal...

- Killing another human is seen as unacceptable, but there are circumstances in which is it seen as permitted

You may agree or disagree with some or all of the following examples:

- If someone is threatening your life (or the lives of others), it is acceptableto defend oneself even if it means killing the other person.
- During a war, it is acceptable to kill the soldiers of the opposing forces.
- It is acceptable to execute prisoners convicted of heinous crimes.
- Some see killing as an acceptable response to blasphemy or apostasy.

##  The Moral Compass

Based on examinations of the brain with fMRI technology, scientists posit thathumans all have the following basic moral evaluation scale:

**Positive**: Care, Fairness, Liberty, Sanctity, Loyalty, Authority
**Negative**: Harm, Cheating, Oppression, Degradation, Betrayal, Subversion

One may consider ehtics as the interconnections between these values.

## Nepotism

Consider nepotism – the idea of giving favour to one’s relatives – comes fromthe Italian word for nephew (hiring practices back then were not like now).

Values supporting it: care and loyalty to the family.

In some countries it would be a serious betrayal not to hire your relatives.

The head of government of Trinidad and Tobago recently took her niece on a world-wide tour, charging her niece’s expenses to the country.

Canadian society, however, frowns upon nepotism.

Everyone else is affected by it: the company, the employees of the company,and ultimately the country as a whole.

Values of fairness to others and preventing harm to others/society are seen as more important than looking after family members.

## Five Whys

All of these values have evolutionary advantage.

This does not, however, mean that each of them is a value that supports civilization and human progress.

Nor does it mean that all values are equally important.

As an engineer, when you consider any ethical situation, you must consideryour choices and why you are taking those choices.

## Empathy
Primates, including humans, have empathy for others in their species.

Mirror neurons will fire when certain activities occur either to oneself or whileone is watching someone else.

Sociopathy is associated with an inability to feel empathy.

Narcissism is an abnormal focus on oneself.

Empathy is something that develops as an infant grows into an adult.

Empathy will be enabled when watching other people in situations involvingpain, disgust, or contact.

Most of you will feel pain when others do.How would you feel if your best friend were injured in a car crash?

Consider a picture of a Dalit, covered in excrement, coming up from having cleared a blockage in the sewers of an Indian city.

## Sympathy vs Empathy

There is a distinction between sympathy and empathy, even though the wordsare sometimes incorrectly used interchangeably.

Sympathy is acknowledgment of another person’s suffering and providing comfort/assistance.

Empathy is understanding how others are feeling (and may be from personal experience or imagining oneself in the other person’s place).

## Liberals vs. Conservatives

For all the fighting we see in politics about liberals vs. conservatives, both groups have morals and attempt to have them enshrined in society.

The major difference is what morals the sides consider important.

We will draw a distinction here between small-l liberal and the Liberal Party;equally a distinction between small-c conservative and the Conservative Party.

Just because the party calls itself something does not mean it follows thosevalues, nor do such parties necessarily take the same stances on all issues...

## A Question of Values

Traditional liberal values include care, fairness, liberty...

Traditional libertarian values put a greater emphasis on liberty:Freedom, individual liberty, voluntary association...

Traditional conservative values include authority, loyalty, sanctity (that generally liberal values de-emphasize).

Fascist values put even more emphasis on authority and loyalty.

## Me Good them bad

- When you reach a different ethical conclusion from someone else, it’s not thatthey’re immoral – they simply have different values.

- The United States Congress has an interesting aspects.

- The outside polarization of Republican – Democrat appears very strong when compared to the Canadian multi-party system.

- There are, however, many more bi-partisan communication and significantly fewer restrictions w.r.t. voting along party lines.

- In Canada, voting along party lines is considered much more essential due to non-confidence votes.

## Ethics and Professional Misconduct

- There is an official PEO Code of Ethics.

- We will now examine it, and the definition of professional misconduct, in the light of the value compass.

## L33: Ethics: PEO Code of Ethics

## Enforceable Codes of Ethics

- In most jurisdictions, the Code of Ethics is enforceable.
- A violation of the code of ethics is professional misconduct.

- In Ontario, the Code of Ethics is not enforceable.
Instead, it lists items considered to be best practices.

Professional misconduct is defined in section 72 of the regulations.

## Always Seven, There Are

The Code of Ethics focuses on seven areas (most of which are about interactions with others):

1. Personal conduct, standards of behaviour, employers, clients, other professionals, other practitioners of engineering, profession of engineering itself

The code of ethics is written into the Regulations (section 77)

## Personal Conduct

1. It is the duty of a practitioner to the public, to the practitioner’s employer, tothe practitioner’s clients, to other members of the practitioner’s profession,and to the practitioner to act at all times with,

i) fairness and loyalty to the practitioner’s associates, employer, clients,subordinates and employees
ii) fidelity to public needs
iii) devotion to high ideals of personal honour and professional integrity
iv) knowledge of developments in the area of professional engineering relevant to any services that are undertaken, and
v) competence in the performance of any professional engineering servicesthat are undertaken
