# Contract Law

## Lecture 4 - Contracts: Intro, Offer & Acceptance

## Introduction to Contracts

- Law enables us to enter voluntarily into obligations (agreements).

- Making deals or bargains is fundamental to society, BUT there needs
to be rules to ensure fairness and consistency.

## What is a contract?

- Mutual agreement between two parties that somethingg is done - a
compact, agreement, bargain; Especially such as has legal effects,
a convention between states.

Ex. A business agreeement for the supply of certain articles or the
performance of specified work at a certain price, rate, or commission.

- An agreement enforeable by **law**

## Why Contracts?

- Contracts expand a person's freedom of choice.

- If someone wants osmething, he or she may bargain for it, by entering
into an obligation for others in exchange for it.

- Happens in the small at the time -> ex. if i want a pizza,
i am willing to spend money to receive it

- Ex. A co-op job is the same: you agree to work for an employer in
exchange for pay (co-op contract)

- Money does **NOT** have to be involved

## Trust

- We need trust that the other party will uphold his/her end of bargain or
else we won't enter into contracts.

- Law is a facilitative process, a passive framework where people can decide
and bargain on their own

- Importantly, trust in the other party is replaced with trust in the legal system:
If the other party does not uphold his/her end, the law provides recourse.

## Good and Bad Deals

- Law does not prevent people from making bad deals

- Ex. I can seal my car for $10, still a bad deal.

- All that matters is a contract is legally enforceable.

## Components of a Legal Contract

- Over time, common law became the following essential elements for an 
agreement to be legally enforeable:

1. An offer is made and accepted
2. There is mutual intent to enter into the contract
3. Consideration - Can be anything of value (item or service), which each
party to a legally binding contract must agree to exchange if the contract
is to be valid. They must be given something for it.

- Ex. I promise you that I will do X, in consideration for which you 
promise me that you will do Y

4. Capacity: The ability, capability, or fitness to do something; a legal
right, power of competency to perform some act - ability to comprehend both
the nature and consequences of one's acts

ex. A capacity defense is used in both criminal and civil actions to describe
a lack of fundamental ability to be accountable for one's action that nullifies
the element of intent when intent is essential to the action, thereby
relieving a person of responsibility for it

5. Lawful Purpose: An agreement is legal and enforceable only if it complies
with the law of the land and public policy. Any agreement entered into for an
illegal purpose is not legally binding

Ex. **Quid pro quo**: Something for something / this for that

- If any one of those items is absent, the contract will not be legally 
enforceable

## Legally Enforceable

- Any agreement, even one not in writing, that possesses all five elements
is enforceable.

- Proving the existence of the contract may be harder if it is not in writing,
but it may still be formed

- Even if the contract is unfair, it will be enforced

- if one element is absent, the courts will decline to intervene

## Intervention

- The terms in a contract include any benefits and obligations usually arrived
at through negotiation and then agreement

- The courts will be willing to step in if a party to a contract does not fulfill
its obligations under the terms

- Courts will not, however, alter the terms of a contract in favour of more fair
or just terms than those that were decided upon.

- The courts may, however, declare a contract void, voidable, or unenforceable.

## Changing a Contract

- A contract can be, through mutual agreement, altered (up to a point).

- The changes must fall within the scope of the original contract

- A contact to build a house may change the design or add a shed

- but a contract to design an apartment cannot be modified to design a house
