##Midterm Advice

- You must be very fluent in ARM assembly
- The solutions to the midterm will NOT be posted

##Slide 12

- Interconnection Network: Circuit needed to transfer information between processor,
memory unit and various number of I/O devices

- A system bus is one example of an interconnection network

- Bus consists of 3 signals: Address, Data, Control

- I/O Devices connect to bus via I/O interface

##Slide 13

- What you see is an I/O interface. 

- The address decoder reads address lines.

- Control circuitry interacts with control signals.

##Slide 14

**Address Decoder**
- Essentially identifies if I/O device is written for or not
- Determines if I/O address is spoken to
- We have to use part of the address
