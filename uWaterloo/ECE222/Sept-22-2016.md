#Stack Frame

- Locations at the top of the processor stack are used as a private work space by subroutines

- Consists of all of the items pushed onto the stack prior to the calling of a subroutine and during the execution of a subroutine

- Difference: As you execute - stack pointer may move.

- From frame pointer to stack pointer

- If you want to use something that typically doesn't change - use frame pointer
