##How to practise assembly

- Use simulator / add startup file / and a program you want

- uvision software

- Difference between CMP and TEQ

##Assemble: Assembles a Program

- Assember: Converts a source program specified in assembly language to an object program specified in machine language

- Assembly language statements in the soruce prorgram are usually written in the following form:

- Label, Operation, Operand(s), Comment

- Operations can either be mnemonics representing program instructions or assembler directives representing tasks that the
assembler directives representing tasks that the assembler must perform

##Assembler Directives

- AREA: Specifies start of the CODE/DATA areas

- ENTRY: Specifies the start point of the program execution (this is beginning of my instructions)

- DCD: Label and initialize data operands (initialize data variables)

- EQU: Delcare symbolic names for constants (give symbolic names or constants)

- RN: Assign COUNTER RN 3 (Assign labels to register names)
