# Specifying Operands

**Addressing Modes**: Different ways for specifying the locations of instruction operands

- The location of instruction operands are specified using an effective address

- The key thing to remember is that the effective address varies depending on the operand itself

## Addressing Modes

- There are many addressing modes - but the ones on the slides are the most basic

- This should allow you to go look and understand how different instruction sets work for the most part.

- Function is how you compute the effective address

## Immediate Addressing

- Example uses an immediate operand (move value 200 into register 0)

Ex. A program to compute A = [B] + 6 could be written in assembly language as follows:

### Say you have a 4-bit instruction. Only two instructions (add/subtract).

1 = ADD 0 = SUB

If he uses 3 bits how many numbers can he represent? 

1 (ADD) 0 1 0 (2) (using bits for the instruction to encode the value)

0 (SUB) 1 0 0 (4)

###Example:

LOAD R1, B - Absolute Addressing for B; Register addressing for R1
ADD R1, R1, #6 - **Immediate addressing for 6** Register addressing for R1
STORE R1, A - Register addressing for R1; Absolute addressing for A
