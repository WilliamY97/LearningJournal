# Specifying Operands

**Addressing Modes**: Different ways for specifying the locations of instruction operands

- The location of instruction operands are specified using an effective address

- The key thing to remember is that the effective address varies depending on the operand itself

## Addressing Modes

- There are many addressing modes - but the ones on the slides are the most basic

- This should allow you to go look and understand how different instruction sets work for the most part.

- Function is how you compute the effective address

## Immediate Addressing

- Example uses an immediate operand (move value 200 into register 0)

Ex. A program to compute A = [B] + 6 could be written in assembly language as follows:

### Say you have a 4-bit instruction. Only two instructions (add/subtract).

1 = ADD 0 = SUB

If he uses 3 bits how many numbers can he represent? 

1 (ADD) 0 1 0 (2) (using bits for the instruction to encode the value)

0 (SUB) 1 0 0 (4)

###Example:

LOAD R1, B - Absolute Addressing for B; Register addressing for R1
ADD R1, R1, #6 - **Immediate addressing for 6** Register addressing for R1
STORE R1, A - Register addressing for R1; Absolute addressing for A

##Register Addressing

- Register addressing is used when an operand is a register

- We have already seen use of register addressing mode

##Absolute (Direct) Addressing

- When you know what the address for the memory location you want to access.

- How does instruction coding work? 

## Register Indirect Addressing

- Used when the address of an operand is stored **in a register or a memory location**

- Example: Load R0, (R1) moves the contents of the memory location pointed to by register R1 to register R0. 

- First (R1) needs to resolve as an address (string of bits).

- What if you actually want to move contents of R1? You use the MOVE instruction. Source operand would be a register. 

- **Why does he use two square brackets?** We take R1 and whatever is in R1 and we use this to index the memory. **If we don't use square brackets would we just send the address?** Yeah.

- Ex. A pointer is an address - to figure out what is stored in the address - you de-reference it.

- Indirect addressing is analagous to the use of pointers (dereferencing) in a high-level language
