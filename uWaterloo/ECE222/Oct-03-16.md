##One-Pass Assembling

- It won't know how to generate offset.
- If you can't synthesize in one pass - do it in multiple passes


##Linkers and Loaders

- You will probably have multiple modules

- Linker: What is the exact offset I need to put to ensure that the code continues in module?

- Use linker to link files into one executable

- **Position independent code:** Code that does not change based on location

Ex. Relative addressing, instructions

- **Position dependent code:** Code that does change based on location

Ex. references to external labels

- You use tools to explicity manage where address are as they change.

- When would you prefer position indep. code? Sometimes you have no choice. If you have multiple
libraries spaced so far apart that you have to use it.
