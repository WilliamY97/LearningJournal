#SDRAM Burst Memory Read

##Latency and Bandwidth

- Latency: Refers to time associated with the completion of the first event in a sequence of events

- Bandwidth: Refers to the amount of data that can be communicated per unit time

##Double-Data Rate (DDR) SDRAM

- DDR SDRAMS deliver increased memory bandwidth by transferring data on both clock edges (doubles the memory bandwidth)

- Organized into two (or more banks) to allow the use of memory interleaving:

The use of two banks for memory interleaving allows simultaneous access to adjacent words in memory

One word (From the first bank) is transferred on the rising edge of the clock while the 2nd word (from 2nd bank) is transferred
on the falling edge of the clock, and so on.

##Memory Controllers

- Advanced SDRAM devices cannot be directly connected to a system bus

- An interface must be creaed to translate bus commands into the signals requried to communicate with the memory devices

##Structure of Larger Memories

- Larger memories combine multiple chips together (Recall the chip-select [CS])

- This might be on exam (Implement that memory with 512 Kib x 8 bits static memory chips)

 - 4 chips providing 32 bits (put 4 in a row) 

##Memory Modules

- Memory modules assemble several memory devices on a small board that can be plugged into a socket on a motherboard:

modules allow easy replacement and expansion

##Read-only Memories (ROM)

- Non-volatile, read-only memories are useful for applications which need to retain stored information when the power is turned off

ROMS come in many varieties:

- PROMS use fuses that are burned out with a high current pulse

- EPROMS are erasable PROMS that use special transistors instead of fuse

- EEPROMS are electrically -erasable PROMS

- Flash memory devices are similar to EEPROMS in functionality
