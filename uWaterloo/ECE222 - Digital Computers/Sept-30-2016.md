##How to practise assembly

- Use simulator / add startup file / and a program you want

- uvision software

- Difference between CMP and TEQ

##Assemble: Assembles a Program

- Assember: Converts a source program specified in assembly language to an object program specified in machine language

- Assembly language statements in the soruce prorgram are usually written in the following form:

- Label, Operation, Operand(s), Comment

- Operations can either be mnemonics representing program instructions or assembler directives representing tasks that the
assembler directives representing tasks that the assembler must perform

##Assembler Directives

- AREA: Specifies start of the CODE/DATA areas

- ENTRY: Specifies the start point of the program execution (this is beginning of my instructions)

- DCD: Label and initialize data operands (initialize data variables)

- EQU: Delcare symbolic names for constants (give symbolic names or constants)

- RN: Assign COUNTER RN 3 (Assign labels to register names)

##Pseudo-Instructions

- Instructions that the assembler accepts but thosethat are synthesized to "actual" instructions

- Ex. LDR Ri, = ADDRESS, Load the address value ADDRESS into register Ri

- If sufficient number of bits ... (LDR R3, = 0x127, => MOV R3, #0x127)

- If not ... LDR R3, = 0xA123B456

- Alternative: Use registers to move to R3. Have multiple 12 bit immediates.

##Example: Sum n numbers:

```
LDR R1,N  Load count into R1
LDR R2, =NUM1 Load address NUM1 into R2
MOV R0, #0  Clear accumulator R0
LOOP LDR  R3, [R2], #4  Load next number into R3 (post index)
ADD R0, R0, R3  Add number into R0
SUBS R1, R1 #1  Decrement loop counter R1
BGT LOOP Branch back if not done
STR R0, SUM Store sum
```
- Try to implement this on the ADM IDE

##Example: Sum n test scores
- Pre-index (write back): Take contents of R2 and increment it by 8. Now retrieve contents and load into R7. Then
update contents of R2 with R2 + 8. (HINT)

- Do you have to make certain assumptions of how the data is laid out? Yeah notice how n is just #8 away from first test score
