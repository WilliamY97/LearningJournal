#Instructions: Test / Compare

- Check most significant bit? Masking... take the original and AND it with 1 and trailing zeros.

- Logical Shift Left (LSF): If you shift unsigned value you x2 

- Logical Shift Right (LSR): Move carry to the right. Least sig fig bit becomes carry. LSR on unisged divides by 2

- LSL = Arithmetic Shift Left

- ASR (Arithmetic Shift Right): 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 -> Most sig. bit is replicated so still the same -> 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1

- Predicated instructions: Use prefix prior to condition to replace branches
