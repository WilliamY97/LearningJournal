#Stack Frame

- Locations at the top of the processor stack are used as a private work space by subroutines

- Consists of all of the items pushed onto the stack prior to the calling of a subroutine and during the execution of a subroutine

- Difference: As you execute - stack pointer may move.

- From frame pointer to stack pointer

- If you want to use something that typically doesn't change - use frame pointer

##Manipulating SP and FP for Stack Frames

- SP currently points at return address

- They currently both point to the same memory address

- Careful: There is a difference between store and move: stores access memory - move actually updates contents of FP

- Key on this page -> how to initialize a stack frame

##Stack Frames with Nested Subroutines

- First three instructions - retrieve value
- 2nd set - retrieve value
- Result -> a parameter2 is first on the stack and then parameter 1. SP is pointing to Param1.
- Subroutine -> first making space on stack (6 words / 24 bytes)
- Add FP, SP #16 (initialize FP)
- Practise
- Load R4, Param3 (place another param on stack and then move SP to it)
- Second subroutine: make 3 spaces for stack
- store frame pointer
- He's not storing return address because no more subroutines
- **What is the point of return address? Why didn't he add one for the second subroutine?**
- Tells you where you want to return to
- Load -> restored values (e.g. frame pointer)
- add sp, sp #12, move SP back to original place (essentially undoing everything we've done)
- **Why do you have to restore everything?** To ensure that the register values previously define outside
scope of the subroutine are still the values they used to be and not the changed values from the subroutine
##Encoding of Machine Instructions

- Assembly instructions express the actions be performed by processor circuitry

- Assembler: Program that converts to machine instructions
