# ISA Characteristics

## RISC Aspects

- Only load and store instructions access memory
- Arithmetic and logic instructions only operate on processor register contents

- 4 bit condition code

- We have to manipulate stack

- Conditional execution: May be chosen to be executed or not (done as a optimization)

##Register Structure

- Each register is 32 bit
- R15 is the program counter
- R13 and R14 is stack pointer and link register

- We looked at how to save return address
- Without interrupts you can't do anything on computer

- CPSR/PSR is a status register.

## Addressing Modes

- All addressing modes derivative of indexed addressing mode

- Computing effective address

- Effective address of memory operand is the sum of the contenets of a base
register Rn and a signed offset

## Addressing Models: Pre-index w/ WB

- After you have actually done the operation, you will essentially write back to register that is index register

- You are automatically incrementing index register when you update it

What does left-shifting do?

- 010 - > 2 if I left shift this by one the binary equivalent is 100 -> 4

- It multiplies number by 2

What does right shifting do?

- Right shift divides, but not always...

- If it were a signed number. If it is a unsigned then it is fine.

## Post-index

- Just update index register after doing operation

- Please practise this

## Summary of Addressing Modes

- In textbook there is a reference of the addressing syntax in ARM

##Instructions: Memory Operations

- Zero extension vs sign extension: interpretation of value

- A positive and negative value is denoted by the operation

- If you interpret a value as a signed number then use signed function
