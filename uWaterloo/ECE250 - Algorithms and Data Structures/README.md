# ECE250 - Algorithms and Data Structures

Introduces concept of data structures through abstract data structures including lists, sorted lists, stacks, queues, deques, sets/maps, directed acyclic graphs, and graphs; and implementations including the use of linked lists, arrays, binary search trees, M-way search trees, hash tables, complete trees, and adjacency matrices and lists.

Introduce the student to algorithms design including greedy, divide-and-conquer, random and backtracking algorithms and dynamic programming; and specific algorithms including, for example, resizing arrays, balancing search trees, shortest path, and spanning trees.
