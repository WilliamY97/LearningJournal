# Heaps

A heap is a typer of data structure. The benefit of them is that you can get the largest element from them in O(1) time.
This is much better than other data structures like an array where the operation is O(n) time. Extracting the largest element
from the heap takes O(logn) time.

These make a heap very good for implementing a priority queue. They also are used in the nlogn sorting algorithm, heap sort, which
works by repeating an extract of the largest element until we have emptied the heap.
