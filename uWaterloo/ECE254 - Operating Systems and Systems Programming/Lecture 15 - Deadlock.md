# Lecture 15 - Deadlock

Definition - The permanent blocking of a set of processes that either compete for system resources or communicate with each other.

A set of processes is deadlocked when each process in the set is blocked on some event that can only be triggered by another blocked
process in the set. In this case it is permanent, because none of the events can take place.

A deadlock involves some conflicting needs for resources by two or more processes.

It occurs when everyone tries to do the same thing at the same time.

## Deadlock Occurence

For deadlock to occur, we do not have to have symmetric processes trying to do the same thing at the
same time.
