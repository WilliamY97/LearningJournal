#Tort Law

- Key idea of tort law is in the idea of a harm suffered by someone

- Basic issue is who shall bear loss? The perpetrator, insurance company society?

- Primary purpose is not to punish wrongdoers, but instead compensate the wronged

- Punishment is left to criminal law system

**Offence**: Breach of a statute, an act of parliament

- Offenses in Criminal Code of Canada merit special attention because conviction
results in a sentence and criminal record.

- Other offences do not result in this record; once punishment is dispensed that is the
end of the matter

- Penalty is punishment to deter would be offenders and hopefully rehabilitate those who
have offended
Crime is an **offence** against the state

##Private Persons

- When a person causes harm to another, the harm may not have broken a law or a contract,
but nevertheless, a person has been harmed

- The injured party may be able to seek compensation through tort law

- The two parties are referred to as the **tortfeasor(wrongdoer)** and **victim**

- Normally the victim can apply to the court for compensation resulting from the harm caused.
The victim will need to show damages.

- The victim can apply to court for compensation from the harm caused, but the victim will
need to show damages (in assignment 2 I guess it's the additional payment required)

- A corporation or other form of business organization is a **"legal person" (not a "natural person")**
and can be a party in tort law.

##Punitive Damages

- Under rare circumstances - the court will award **punitive damages**. This is another way of punishing the 
**tortfeasor (wrongdoer)**.

- There are a number of arguments for and against **punitive damages**..

- Usually only award when tortfeasor is especailly malicious, egregious, intentional... etc

##Development of the Tort Concept

- In early days of tort law, it was very simple: anyone who caused violent injury to another had to pay

- Ex. A man is walking down the road and trampled by a horse loose from a carriage 

e- Under the old system, the owner is responsible - end of story.

- Over time the concept was refined to include idea of **fault** so if he was careless and let the
horse escape then he is liable but if horse was scared by snake then it is beyond operator's control
and he is not considered liable

- Tort was also expanded to include less direct situations

- Ex. Suppose A carelessly drops a log on the road at sunset and leaves it there.

B's horse trips over the log and is injured.... in early times it was not recognized as A's fault
but later on the corut recognized that A's action (**inaction**) was responsible for B's injury,
indirectly, and this allowed B to recover damages.

- So now the law accounts for both fault and **causation**.

##Elements of Tort Action

- To establish the right to recover compensation, the plaintiff must prove:

**1.** The defendant owed the plaintiff a duty of care.
**2.** The defendant breached that duty by his or her conduct.
**3.** The defendant's conduct caused injury to the plaintiff.

- If any one of those elements is absent, the action will fail.

##Duty of Care

**Duty of Care:** a duty that a person has to ensure that others do not suffer a harm or loss

- A duty typically arises when a person takes an action that could reasonably harm others, such as
driving or providing engineering consulting services.

- **Reasonableness** is a very large element of tort law.

- The courts will usually hold parties to the standard of **"the conduct expected of a reasonable
person under the circumstances"** 

##Causation

- The third element in the list requires the plaintiff to establish causation

- Ex. Suppose that Alison breaks a plat on Monday at dinner time.

The next day, her wife Bether makes a special trip by car to a shop to replace it.

On her way she gets in a car crash

Is Alison's carelessness in dropping the plate responsible for the car accident?

**In the law** she did not. It is true she dropped the plate and caused her wife to drive, but
many voluntary acts occured between the dropping of the plate and the car crash. Beth could
have chosen to go at another time, as the other drive might have.

These **voluntary acts** decouple the two events. **Causation can be traced back to the voluntary acts
but no further**

Another idea: crash could have occured due to carelessness on the part of Beth or the other driver.

**General Rule**: The closer a person is to the event in question, the less chance there is of an
intervening event.

##Burden of Proof

- The burden of proof in tort law is somewhat complex... in tort law - **the injured party need only
demonstrate the defendant's product caused the injury; not the exact details of how**

- Then the defendant must prove that they are not responsible for the injury. The burden has shifted to the
defendant in that case.

##Intentional Torts

- Torts can be classified based on intent

- An **intentional tort** is one where the tortfeasor deliberately performs an action which harms another.

- For the most part ** in this class we focus on unintentional torts**.
