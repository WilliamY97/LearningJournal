#Tort Law

- Key idea of tort law is in the idea of a harm suffered by someone

- Basic issue is who shall bear loss? The perpetrator, insurance company society?

- Primary purpose is not to punish wrongdoers, but instead compensate the wronged

- Punishment is left to criminal law system

**Offence**: Breach of a statute, an act of parliament
