#Tort Law

- Key idea of tort law is in the idea of a harm suffered by someone

- Basic issue is who shall bear loss? The perpetrator, insurance company society?

- Primary purpose is not to punish wrongdoers, but instead compensate the wronged

- Punishment is left to criminal law system

**Offence**: Breach of a statute, an act of parliament

- Offenses in Criminal Code of Canada merit special attention because conviction
results in a sentence and criminal record.

- Other offences do not result in this record; once punishment is dispensed that is the
end of the matter

- Penalty is punishment to deter would be offenders and hopefully rehabilitate those who
have offended
Crime is an **offence** against the state

##Private Persons

- When a person causes harm to another, the harm may not have broken a law or a contract,
but nevertheless, a person has been harmed

- The injured party may be able to seek compensation through tort law

- The two parties are referred to as the **tortfeasor(wrongdoer)** and **victim**

- Normally the victim can apply to the court for compensation resulting from the harm caused.
The victim will need to show damages.

- The victim can apply to court for compensation from the harm caused, but the victim will
need to show damages (in assignment 2 I guess it's the additional payment required)

- A corporation or other form of business organization is a **"legal person" (not a "natural person")**
and can be a party in tort law.

##Punitive Damages

- Under rare circumstances - the court will award **punitive damages**. This is another way of punishing the 
**tortfeasor (wrongdoer)**.

- There are a number of arguments for and against **punitive damages**..

- Usually only award when tortfeasor is especailly malicious, egregious, intentional... etc

##Development of the Tort Concept

- In early days of tort law, it was very simple: anyone who caused violent injury to another had to pay

- Ex. A man is walking down the road and trampled by a horse loose from a carriage 

- Under the old system, the owner is responsible - end of story.

- Over time the concept was refined to include idea of **fault** so if he was careless and let the
horse escape then he is liable but if horse was scared by snake then it is beyond operator's control
and he is not considered liable
