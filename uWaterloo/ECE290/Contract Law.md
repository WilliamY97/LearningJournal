# Contract Law

## Lecture 4 - Contracts: Intro, Offer & Acceptance

## Introduction to Contracts

- Law enables us to enter voluntarily into obligations (agreements).

- Making deals or bargains is fundamental to society, BUT there needs
to be rules to ensure fairness and consistency.

##What is a contract?

- Mutual agreement between two parties that somethingg is done - a
compact, agreement, bargain; Especially such as has legal effects,
a convention between states.

Ex. A business agreeement for the supply of certain articles or the
performance of specified work at a certain price, rate, or commission.

- An agreement enforeable by **law**

##Why Contracts?

- Contracts expand a person's freedom of choice.

- If someone wants osmething, he or she may bargain for it, by entering
into an obligation for others in exchange for it.

- Happens in the small at the time -> ex. if i want a pizza,
i am willing to spend money to receive it

- Ex. A co-op job is the same: you agree to work for an employer in
exchange for pay (co-op contract)

- Money does **NOT** have to be involved

##Trust

- We need trust that the other party will uphold his/her end of bargain or
else we won't enter into contracts.

- Law is a facilitative process, a passive framework where people can decide
and bargain on their own

- Importantly, trust in the other party is replaced with trust in the legal system:
If the other party does not uphold his/her end, the law provides recourse.

##Good and Bad Deals

- Law does not prevent people from making bad deals

- Ex. I can seal my car for $10, still a bad deal.

- All that matters is a contract is legally enforceable.

##Components of a Legal Contract

- Over time, common law became the following essential elements for an 
agreement to be legally enforeable:

1. An offer is made and accepted
2. There is mutual intent to enter into the contract
3. Consideration - Can be anything of value (item or service), which each
party to a legally binding contract must agree to exchange if the contract

- Ex. I promise you that I will do X, in consideration for which you 
promise me that you will do Y

is to be valid. They must be given something for it. 
4. Capacity
5. Lawful Purpose

Ex. **Quid pro quo**: Something for something / this for that

- If any one of those items is absent, the contract will not be legally 
enforceable

##Legally Enforceable

- Any agreement, even one not in writing, that possesses all five elements
is enforceable.

- Proving the existence of the contract may be harder if it is not in writing,
but it may still be formed

- even if the contract is unfair, it will be enforced

- if one element is absent, the courts will decline to intervene
