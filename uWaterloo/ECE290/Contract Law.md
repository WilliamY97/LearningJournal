# Contract Law

## Lecture 4 - Contracts: Intro, Offer & Acceptance

## Introduction to Contracts

- Law enables us to enter voluntarily into obligations (agreements).

- Making deals or bargains is fundamental to society, BUT there needs
to be rules to ensure fairness and consistency.

##What is a contract?

- Mutual agreement between two parties that somethingg is done - a
compact, agreement, bargain; Especially such as has legal effects,
a convention between states.

Ex. A business agreeement for the supply of certain articles or the
performance of specified work at a certain price, rate, or commission.

- An agreement enforeable by **law**

##Why Contracts?

- Contracts expand a person's freedom of choice.

- If someone wants osmething, he or she may bargain for it, by entering
into an obligation for others in exchange for it.

- Happens in the small at the time -> ex. if i want a pizza,
i am willing to spend money to receive it

- Ex. A co-op job is the same: you agree to work for an employer in
exchange for pay (co-op contract)

- Money does **NOT** have to be involved

##Trust

- We need trust that the other party will uphold his/her end of bargain or
else we won't enter into contracts.

- Law is a facilitative process, a passive framework where people can decide
and bargain on their own

- Importantly, trust in the other party is replaced with trust in the legal system:
If the other party does not uphold his/her end, the law provides recourse.
