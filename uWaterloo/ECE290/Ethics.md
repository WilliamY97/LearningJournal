##Synopsis:
There exist a number of prescription drugs called nootropics, which are intended to improve concentration, fo-cus, and general cognitive (brain) function. These have legitimate medical uses as treatments for conditions likenarcolepsy. In recent years, students have been acquiring these medications without a prescription, not to treatany condition, but in the hopes of improving studying, assignment, and test-taking performance. The term “studydrugs” is sometimes used to refer to the various medications in question.Is the use of study drugs (without a diagnosis and appropriate prescription) ethical? Your answer should reference **the values in the compass discussed in lectures. You should also evaluate this question using at least one of the ethical theories discussed in the lectures**. It is permitted to use ethical theories not discussed in class to evaluatethis question. Please note that nothing will be read into your answer; you need not personally believe the position you choose to support in your essay and neither markers nor anyone else will make any assumptions.

##Lecture 30 - Ethics: Introduction

- Ethics sare about moral principles; about how we know what is "right" and what is "wrong"

- Instead of starting with a long discussion of the subject - let's look at an exercise where we examine ethical situations.

- In all of them, we must make a decision.

##The Runaway Train Car, Scenario 1

In the first example, our decision is binary:
A. Do nothing B. Pull the lever

1A: There are five workers on the current line and one on the parallel track. What do you do?

1B: What if there are only two workers on the main line?

1C: What if there are 50 workers? etc. etc.

Also an example from a car crash where one person may be sacrificed to save five severely injured people.

##Professional Engineering Ethics

- The definition of professional misconduct includes those behaviours that a professional engineer in Ontario must not engage in.

- These define an absolute line which must not be crossed.

- Note that one can be guilty of professional misconduct even if there are no negative consequences.

- In general, however, complaints are a result of an action or behaviour having a negative consequence.

##Big Questions

- Should we regulate how professional engineers interact with other professionals?
- Should P. Eng.'s exaggerate their abilities or the abilities of the profession?
- Should professional engineers malign the character of others in the profession?
- You find that your designs had a flaw due to an unknown effect not anticipated in normal engineering practce: is
sufficient to fix the mistake but not tell anyone about it?
- Is it right to take credit for the work done by your subordinates and co-op students working under you?
