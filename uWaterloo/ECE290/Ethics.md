##Synopsis:
There exist a number of prescription drugs called nootropics, which are intended to improve concentration, fo-cus, and general cognitive (brain) function. These have legitimate medical uses as treatments for conditions likenarcolepsy. In recent years, students have been acquiring these medications without a prescription, not to treatany condition, but in the hopes of improving studying, assignment, and test-taking performance. The term “studydrugs” is sometimes used to refer to the various medications in question.Is the use of study drugs (without a diagnosis and appropriate prescription) ethical? Your answer should reference **the values in the compass discussed in lectures. You should also evaluate this question using at least one of the ethical theories discussed in the lectures**. It is permitted to use ethical theories not discussed in class to evaluatethis question. Please note that nothing will be read into your answer; you need not personally believe the position you choose to support in your essay and neither markers nor anyone else will make any assumptions.

##Lecture 30 - Ethics: Introduction

- Ethics sare about moral principles; about how we know what is "right" and what is "wrong"

- Instead of starting with a long discussion of the subject - let's look at an exercise where we examine ethical situations.

- In all of them, we must make a decision.

##The Runaway Train Car, Scenario 1

In the first example, our decision is binary:
A. Do nothing B. Pull the lever

1A: There are five workers on the current line and one on the parallel track. What do you do?

1B: What if there are only two workers on the main line?

1C: What if there are 50 workers? etc. etc.

Also an example from a car crash where one person may be sacrificed to save five severely injured people.

##Professional Engineering Ethics

- The definition of professional misconduct includes those behaviours that a professional engineer in Ontario must not engage in.

- These define an absolute line which must not be crossed.

- Note that one can be guilty of professional misconduct even if there are no negative consequences.

- In general, however, complaints are a result of an action or behaviour having a negative consequence.

##Big Questions

- Should we regulate how professional engineers interact with other professionals?
- Should P. Eng.'s exaggerate their abilities or the abilities of the profession?
- Should professional engineers malign the character of others in the profession?
- You find that your designs had a flaw due to an unknown effect not anticipated in normal engineering practce: is
sufficient to fix the mistake but not tell anyone about it?
- Is it right to take credit for the work done by your subordinates and co-op students working under you?

##Morals

- A moral, meaning a custom or a habit is an action, behaviour, character trait or desire that has been determined to be:
1. Right or wrong
2. Good or bad
3. Saintly or evil
4. Honourable or dishonourable
5. Brave or cowardly

- It is based on a general consensus of society. They are not based in law or regulations; there are immoral rules and immoral orders.

##Ethics

- The study of ethics or moral philosophy is the study of human interactions.
- It is for determining or recommending whether an actions, behaviours, conduct, or desires is right or wrong, including:
ex. actions, behaviours, characteristics, desires

- There are two general definitions of ethics.

1. A collection or system of moral principles or rules of conduct by which a person or association is guided.
2. The science of morals; the department of study concerned with the principles of human duty.

##Hippocratic Oath

- The Hippocratic Oath and Professional Engineers Ontario Code of Ethics are two examples of collections of rules of conduct
- In many jurisdictions, a code of ethics defines the boundary between professional conduct and misconduct.

- We will see later, that PEO's Code of Ethics provide a guide to conduct while, as we've seen, misconduct is explicitly
defined in the regulations.

##Ethics: The Science of Morals

Ethics is itself broken into numerous categories:

- **Meta-ethics:** The theoretical inquiry of moral principles and how their truth values (if any) may be determined.
- **Normative Ethics:** Concerning the practical means of determining a moral course of action.
- **Applied Ethics:** Situation-based moral outcomes
- **Descriptive Ethics:** The study of extant ethical behaviour and comparative analysis
- **Moral Psychology:** The scientific study of the development and evolution of ethical behaviour

##Normative Ethics

We will focus entirely on normative ethics:

- Concerning the practical means of determining a moral course of action
- Normative ethics tends to be prescriptive: it prescribes how to deal with a particular ethical situation
- Descriptive ethics is empirical: it investigates a society's response in dealing with a particular ethical situation

##Virtue Ethics

- Asks how a response to a situation will affect the percieved character of the person
- Helping a person in need would be charitable, and viewed positively.
- A decision on whether or not to lie would be judged on how that falsehood reflects on the individual's character
- First discussed in western philosophy by Plato and then Aristotle.
- Plato lists four cardinal moral virtues: courage, temperance, justice, prudence.
- Each is the golden mean between two extremes.

##Role Ethics

- Morality is derived from people's relationship with their community and is not individualistic.

- Confucianism demonstrates this through the concept of filial piety as a desire and not only as an action

"In serving his parents, a filial son reveres them in daily life; he makes them happy while he nourishes them;
he takes anxious care of them in sickeness; he shows great sorrow over their death; and he sacrifices to them with solemnity"


##Lecture 31 - Ethics: Modern Ethical Theories

##Agree to Disagree

- In this course you will be exposed to different ethical theories and different points of view. So far we have already seen
the opinions of others...

- You may agree with some of the theories under discussion, disagree with others...

- You may nevertheless be required to answer questions based on these theories, regardless of your personal beliefs

- This is not a natural science where there are correct answers ("the world is round, not flat"); reasonable people
can agree to disagree civilly.

##With Support

- Therefore, we must understand that you know how to make an ethical decision by making a reason decision based on underlying assumptions.

- Your opinion in class is invaluable - it will make for fascinating discussions.

- Your opinion on an examination, without a logical support, is worth nothing.

- "Because I said so" -type argumens and "I feel like this is true" are not adequate reasoons to support the assertions

##Deontology

- The science of duty; the branch of knowledge that deals with moral obligations; ethics.

- Deontology determines the morality of an action, behaviour, character, or desire based on its adherence to a rule or rules.

- It is also known as duty-based ethics.

- Deontology was the first modern ethical theory.

- It is based heavily on concepts such as moral absolutism and divine command theory

- It posts that there are rules or duties that must be followed and that by fulfilling one's duties or following these
rules one is ethical.

- Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) argued an action is good only if it is the consequence of duty as opposed to desire or need.

- He also argued that good intentions, rather than good outcomes, are what make an act moral.

- After all, bad things may happen by accident, but intent is important.

- Kant saw a need for universal principles that guided human behaviour and conscience.

- This led him to introduce the idea of a **categorical imperative**
