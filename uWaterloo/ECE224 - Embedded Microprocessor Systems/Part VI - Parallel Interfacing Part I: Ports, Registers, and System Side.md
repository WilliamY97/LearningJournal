# Part VI - Parallel Interfacing Part I: Ports, Registers, and System Side

## Interface

- An I/O interface connects a device to a computer system.

- The interface translates between the physical signals (ex. current, voltage level) and the protocol (ex. synchronous bus) of the
interconnection network used by the computer system and those required by the device.

- We divide the interface in two parts:

System Side: Depends on interconnection network
Device Side: Depends on device
