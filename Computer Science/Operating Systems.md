#Operating Systems

##What Is An Operating System?

Computing systems consist of a number of hardware components. This includes one or more processing elements (processors or CPU's). There
is also memory, devices like network interconnects (Ethernet / Wifi Card), Graphics Processing Cards (GPU's), and also storage devices like
hard disks, SSDs, and flash devices like USB drives. **All of these components are used by several applications.**

- An operating system is the layer of systems of software that sits between the complex hardware and all these applications.

##Purpose

- Hides hardware complexity from both applications, and application developers. 

- Resource Management, helps figure out which one of the hardware resources each application uses and how much. (Ex. Allocates memory)

- Provide isolation and protection, make application's not access each other's memory,
