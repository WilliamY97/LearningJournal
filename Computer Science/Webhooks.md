# Webhooks

Kind of like an automated version of an API call. You subscribe to specific events and then when they are triggered an HTTP POST
payload is sent to the webhook's configured url. 

```Webhooks can be used to update an external issue tracker, trigger CI builds, update a backup mirror, or even deploy to your production server. 
You're only limited by your imagination.```
