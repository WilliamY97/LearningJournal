#Dynamic Programming

A method for solving complex problems by breaking it down to simpler subproblems and storing their solutions using
a memory-based data structure.

The storage of these solutions can then be referenced when the same subproblem occurs, which saves computation time at
the expense of a slight cost of space. 

The technique of storing solutions instead of recomputing them is called **memoization**
