# 2.4 Java Streams

Lecture Summary: In this lecture we learned about Java streams, and how they provide a functional approach
to operating on collections of data. For example, the statement, “students.stream().forEach(s → System.out.println(s));”,
is a succinct way of specifying an action to be performed on each element s in the collection, students. An 
aggregate data query or data transformation can be specified by building a stream pipeline consisting of a 
source (typically by invoking the .stream() method on a data collection , a sequence of intermediate operations
such as map() and filter(), and an optional terminal operation such as forEach() or average(). As an example, 
the following pipeline can be used to compute the average age of all active students using Java streams:

```
students.stream()
    .filter(s -> s.getStatus() == Student.ACTIVE)
    .map(a -> a.getAge())
    .average();
```

From the viewpoint of this course, an important benefit of using Java streams when possible is that the pipeline
can be made to execute in parallel by designating the source to be a parallel stream, i.e., by simply replacing
students.stream() in the above code by students.parallelStream() or Stream.of(students).parallel(). This form of
functional parallelism is a major convenience for the programmer, since they do not need to worry about explicitly
allocating intermediate collections (e.g., a collection of all active students), or about ensuring that parallel 
accesses to data collections are properly synchronized.
