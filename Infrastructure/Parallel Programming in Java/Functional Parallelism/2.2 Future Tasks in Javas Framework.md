# 2.2 Creating Future Tasks in Java’s Fork/Join Framework

Lecture Summary: In this lecture, we learned how to express future tasks in Java’s Fork/Join (FJ) framework. Some key differences between future tasks and regular tasks in the FJ framework are as follows:

1. A future task extends the RecursiveTask class in the FJ framework, instead of RecursiveAction as in regular tasks.

2. The 𝚌𝚘𝚖𝚙𝚞𝚝𝚎() method of a future task must have a non-void return type, whereas it has a void return type for regular tasks.

3. A method call like 𝚕𝚎𝚏𝚝.𝚓𝚘𝚒𝚗() waits for the task referred to by object 𝚕𝚎𝚏𝚝 in both cases, but also provides the task’s return value in the case of future tasks.
