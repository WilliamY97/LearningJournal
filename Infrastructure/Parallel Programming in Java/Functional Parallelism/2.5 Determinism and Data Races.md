# 2.5 Determinism and Data Races

Lecture Summary: In this lecture, we studied the relationship between determinism and data races in parallel programs. 

A parallel program is said to be **functionally deterministic** if it always computes the **same answer when given the same input**, 
and **structurally deterministic** if it always **computes the same computation graph, when given the same input**. The presence of 
data races often leads to functional and/or structural nondeterminism because a parallel program with data races may exhibit
different behaviors for the same input, depending on the relative scheduling and timing of memory accesses involved in a data race.

In general, the **absence of data races is not sufficient to guarantee determinism**. However, all the parallel constructs introduced
in this course (“Parallelism”) were carefully selected to ensure the following Determinism Property:

If a parallel program is written using the constructs introduced in this course and **is guaranteed to never exhibit a data race,
then it must be both functionally and structurally deterministic**.

Note that the determinism property states that all data-race-free parallel programs written using the constructs introduced in
this course are guaranteed to be deterministic, but it **does not imply that a program with a data race must be functionally/structurally
non-deterministic**. Furthermore, there may be cases of **“benign” nondeterminism** for programs with data races in which **different executions
with the same input may generate different outputs**, but **all the outputs may be acceptable** in the context of the application, 
e.g., different locations for a search pattern in a target string.
