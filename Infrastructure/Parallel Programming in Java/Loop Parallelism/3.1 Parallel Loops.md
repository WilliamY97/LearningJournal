# 3.1 Parallel Loops

Lecture Summary: In this lecture, we learned different ways of expressing parallel loops. The most general way is to think of each
iteration of a parallel loop as an async task, with a finish construct encompassing all iterations. This approach can support 
general cases such as parallelization of the following pointer-chasing while loop (in pseudocode):

```
finish {
for (p = head; p != null ; p = p.next) async compute(p);
}
```

However, further efficiencies can be gained by paying attention to counted-for loops for which the number of iterations is known
on entry to the loop (before the loop executes its first iteration). We then learned the forall notation for expressing parallel
counted-for loops, such as in the following vector addition statement (in pseudocode):

```
forall (i : [0:n-1]) a[i] = b[i] + c[i]
```

We also discussed the fact that Java streams can be an elegant way of specifying parallel loop computations that produce a single
output array, e.g., by rewriting the vector addition statement as follows:

```
a = IntStream.rangeClosed(0, N-1).parallel().toArray(i -> b[i] + c[i]);
```

In summary, streams are a convenient notation for parallel loops with at most one output array, but the forall notation is more 
convenient for loops that create/update multiple output arrays, as is the case in many scientific computations. For generality,
we will use the forall notation for parallel loops in the remainder of this module.
