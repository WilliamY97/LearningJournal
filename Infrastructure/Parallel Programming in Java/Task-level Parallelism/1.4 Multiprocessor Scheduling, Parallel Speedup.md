# 1.4 Multiprocessor Scheduling, Parallel Speedup

Lecture Summary: In this lecture, we studied the possible executions of a Computation Graph (CG) on an idealized parallel machine with P 
processors. It is idealized because all processors are assumed to be identical, and the execution time of a node is assumed to be fixed,
regardless of which processor it executes on. A **legal schedule** is one that obeys the dependence constraints in the CG, such that for 
every directed edge (A, B), the schedule guarantees that step B is only scheduled after step A completes. Unless other specified, we 
will restrict our attention in this course to schedules that have no unforced idleness, i.e., schedules in which a processor is not 
permitted to be idle if a CG node is available to be scheduled on it. Such schedules are also referred to as **"greedy" schedules**.

We defined **TP as the execution time of a CG on P processors**, and observed that T∞ ≤ TP ≤ T1 (T1 is execution time with 1 processor). 
We also saw examples for which there could be **different values of TP for different schedules**.

We then defined the **parallel speedup for a given schedule of a CG on P processors as Speedup(P) = T1/TP**, and observed that **Speedup(P) 
must be ≤ the number of processors P** , and also ≤ the ideal parallelism, WORK/SPAN.
