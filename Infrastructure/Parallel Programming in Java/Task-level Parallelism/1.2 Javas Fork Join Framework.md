# 1.2 Creating Tasks in Java's Fork/Join Framework

In this lecture, we learned how to implement the async and finish functionality using Java’s standard Fork/Join (FJ) framework.
In this framework, a task can be specified in the 𝚌𝚘𝚖𝚙𝚞𝚝𝚎() method of a user-defined class that extends the standard RecursiveAction
class in the FJ framework. In our Array Sum example, we created class 𝙰𝚂𝚞𝚖 with fields 𝙰 for the input array, 𝙻𝙾 and 𝙷𝙸 for the subrange
for which the sum is to be computed, and 𝚂𝚄𝙼 for the result for that subrange. For an instance of this user-defined class (e.g., 𝙻 in
the lecture), we learned that the method call, 𝙻.𝚏𝚘𝚛𝚔(), creates a new task that executes 𝙻’s 𝚌𝚘𝚖𝚙𝚞𝚝𝚎() method. This implements the 
functionality of the async construct that we learned earlier. The call to 𝙻.𝚓𝚘𝚒𝚗() then waits until the computation created by 𝙻.𝚏𝚘𝚛𝚔()
has completed. Note that 𝚓𝚘𝚒𝚗() is a lower-level primitive than finish because 𝚓𝚘𝚒𝚗() waits for a specific task, whereas finish 
implicitly waits for all tasks created in its scope. To implement the finish construct using 𝚓𝚘𝚒𝚗() operations, you have to be sure
to call 𝚓𝚘𝚒𝚗() on every task created in the finish scope.

A sketch of the Java code for the ASum class is as follows:

```
private static class ASum extends RecursiveAction {
  int[] A; // input array
  int LO, HI; // subrange
  int SUM; // return value
  . . .
  @Override
  protected void compute() {
    SUM = 0;
    for (int i = LO; i <= HI; i++) SUM += A[i];
  } // compute()
}
```

FJ tasks are executed in a ForkJoinPool, which is a pool of Java threads. This pool supports the invokeAll() method that combines both
the 𝚏𝚘𝚛𝚔 and 𝚓𝚘𝚒𝚗 operations by executing a set of tasks in parallel, and waiting for their completion. For example, 𝚒𝚗𝚟𝚘𝚔𝚎𝙰𝚕𝚕(𝚕𝚎𝚏𝚝,𝚛𝚒𝚐𝚑𝚝)
implicitly performs 𝚏𝚘𝚛𝚔() operations on 𝚕𝚎𝚏𝚝 and 𝚛𝚒𝚐𝚑𝚝, followed by 𝚓𝚘𝚒𝚗() operations on both objects.
