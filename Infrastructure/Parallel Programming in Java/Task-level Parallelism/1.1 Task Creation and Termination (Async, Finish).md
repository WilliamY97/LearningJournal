# 1.1 Task Creation and Termination (Async, Finish)

Lecture Summary: In this lecture, we learned the concepts of **task creation** and **task termination** in parallel programs, 
using array-sum as an illustrative example. We learned the async notation for task creation: “async ⟨stmt1⟩”, causes
the parent task (i.e., the task executing the async statement) to create a new child task to execute the body of the
async, ⟨stmt1⟩, asynchronously (i.e., before, after, or in parallel) with the remainder of the parent task. We also
learned the finish notation for task termination: “finish ⟨stmt2⟩” causes the parent task to execute ⟨stmt2⟩, and 
then wait until ⟨stmt2⟩ and all async tasks created within ⟨stmt2⟩ have completed. Async and finish constructs may 
be arbitrarily nested.

The example studied in the lecture can be abstracted by the following pseudocode:

```
finish {
  async S1; // asynchronously compute sum of the lower half of the array
  S2;       // compute sum of the upper half of the array in parallel with S1
}
S3; // combine the two partial sums after both S1 and S2 have finished
```
