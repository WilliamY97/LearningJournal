# Docker

Docker is an open source container based technology. Containers allow developers to package up an application in all of its parts so the stack that it runs on, the dependencies that are associated with it - package it all up in this box (container) which is an isolated environment that hass it needs to run. 

This means the underlying operating system, the environment that it runs on is completely abstracted from the application and the problem that this solves is **dependency hell** aka. build an application on a development machine only to have it deployed to a QA machine or a production environment and all of a sudden it doesn't work anymore.

In essence, Docker seperates applications from infrastructure using container technology similar to how virtual machines seperate the operating system from bare metal.

## Docker Benefits

- Build any app in any language using any stack
- Dockerized apps can run almost anywhere

## Why Are Containers So Popular Now?

Docker brings containerization to masses, it provides this workflow fo round containers that makes it easy for everyone to use this concept.
