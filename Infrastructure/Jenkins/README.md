# Jenkins

Jenkins is a software that allows **continous integration**. It will be installed on a server where the central build takes place. Essentially
it takes the changed source code from a developer and trigger a build and run any tests if required. The output will then be available in the
Jenkins dashboard. Automatic notifcations can also be sent back to the developer.
