# Memory Leak

![Reference Image](http://www.programcreek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/where-is-memory-leak-650x400.jpeg)

- In Computer Science, a **memory leak** occurs when a computer program incorrectly manages memory allocations in such a way that
memory which is no longer needed is not released. In OOP, this can occur when an object is stored in memory but cannot be accessed
by the running code.

- **Because they can exhaust available system memory as an application runs, memory leaks are often the cause of or a contributing
factor to **software aging**

- It reduces the performance of the computer by reducing the total amount of available memory. Eventually, in the worst case, too
much of the available memory may become allocated and all or part of the system or device stops working correctly - the application
fails, or the system slows down vastly due to **thrashing**.
