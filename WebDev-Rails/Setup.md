#Setup

- Setting up new application for Rails

```
rails new
```

Creates a new Rails app named MySite. It generated a number of files and folders that we will use to build the app.

```
bundle install
```

Installed all the software packages needed by the new Rails app. These software packages are called **gems** and 
they are listed in the file **Gemfile**.

```
rails server
```

Started the Rails development server so that we could preview the app in the browser by visiting http://localhost:8000.
This development server is called WEBrick.
