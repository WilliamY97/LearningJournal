#B-Trees

##Disk Based Data Structures

- So far searchtrees were limited to main memory structures

- Counter-example: transaction data of a bank > 1GB per day

- Consequence: make a search tree structure secondary-storage-enabled

##Binary Trees vs. B-trees

- Size of B-tree is determined by the page size. One page - one node.
