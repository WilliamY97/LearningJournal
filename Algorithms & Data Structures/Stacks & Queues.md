## Stacks & Queues

- Is an abstract data type (interface)

- Basic operations: pop(), push(), and peek()

- **LIFO** Structure: Last in First out

- In most high level languages, a stack can be easily implemented with arrays or linked lists

- A number of languages are stack-oriented, meaning they define most basic operations (adding two numbers, printing a character)
as taking their arguments from the stack, and placing any return values back on the stack.
