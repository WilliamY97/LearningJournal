#Abstract Data Types

- Allows work to be broken into pieces that can be worked on independently without compromising correctness

- Serve as specifications of requirements for the building blocks of solutions to algorithmic problems

- Encapsulate **data structures** and algorithms that implement them

**ex.** A dictionary is a ADT that can be realized with different data structures such as Arrays, Binary Trees, Linked Lists, AVL Trees, Queues,
B-Trees, Stacks, Heaps, and Hash Tables
