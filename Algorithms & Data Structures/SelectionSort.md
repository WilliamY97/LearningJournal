#Selection Sort

- Basic idea behind selection sort is to divide list into sorted and unsorted portions.

- At each step, a number is moved from unsorted to sorted.

- Even though a number might be in the right location, our algorithm has no way
of knowing that until the entire list is sorted

- We consider entire list as unsorted until we sort it ourselves

**Goal:** We want the list to be in ascending order. We'll want to build up our
list from left to right, smallest to largest.
