# Recurrent Neural Networks

The core of these notes have been taken from reading the blog post http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/

Traditional neural networks do not address the concept of persistence. The idea that you don't throw everything you understood
before away and start thinking from scratch again. Recurrent neural networks address this issue, they are networks with loops
in them, allowing for information to persist.
