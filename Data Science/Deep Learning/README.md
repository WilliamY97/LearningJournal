# Deep Learning

Deep Learning is a branch of machine learning that uses variations of neural networks to teach computers how to perform certain tasks. Examples include computer vision, speech recognition, and much more.

This file contains my notes regarding the information I have learned about this topic from lectures and personal research.

My personal projects that involve more of the application of the theory I have learned can be found at:
