# Convolutional Networks

Convolutional Networks are neural networks that share their parameters across space.

If the data has some structure, and the neural network doesn't have to learn that structure from scratch, it's going to perform better.
For example in classifying letters, the attribute of color does not play a role in what makes an A an A.

**Translation Invariance:** Showing explicitly, that objects and images are largely the same whether or not they are on the left or on the right of the picture.

**Weight Sharing:** When you know two inputs can contain the same kind of information, then you join their weights and train the weights
jointly for those inputs.
