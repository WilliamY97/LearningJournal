## Tensor
In TensorFlow, data isnâ€™t stored as integers, floats, or strings. These values are encapsulated in an object called a tensor. In the case of ```hello_constant = tf.constant('Hello World!')```, hello_constant is a 0-dimensional string tensor, but tensors come in a variety of sizes as shown below:

```
# A is a 0-dimensional int32 tensor
A = tf.constant(1234) 
# B is a 1-dimensional int32 tensor
B = tf.constant([123,456,789]) 
 # C is a 2-dimensional int32 tensor
C = tf.constant([ [123,456,789], [222,333,444] ])
```
