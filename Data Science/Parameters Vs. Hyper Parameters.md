# Parameters Vs. Hyper Parameters

A **parameter** in general is a variable of a model that the ML system trains on its own. A good example is
**weights** which are values the ML system itself gradually alters through successive training iterations.

In contrast is the **hyperparameter** which is the "knobs" that you tweak during successive runs of training
a model. For example, **learning rate** is a hyperparameter.
