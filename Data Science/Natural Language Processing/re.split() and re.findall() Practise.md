Remember, you can use "\w" to match alphanumeric, "\d" to match digits, "\s" to match spaces and "+" to make anything greedy. For groupings, you can use square brackets [] to declare part of the pattern or the entire pattern.

Input:
```
# Import the regex module
import re

print(my_string)

# Write a pattern to match sentence endings: sentence_endings
sentence_endings = r"[.?!]"

# Split my_string on sentence endings and print the result
print(re.split(sentence_endings, my_string))

# Find all capitalized words in my_string and print the result
capitalized_words = r"[A-Z]\w+"
print(re.findall(capitalized_words, my_string))

# Split my_string on spaces and print the result
spaces = r"\s+"
print(re.split(spaces, my_string))

# Find all digits in my_string and print the result
digits = r"\d+"
print(re.findall(digits, my_string))
```

Output:
```
<script.py> output:
    Let's write RegEx!  Won't that be fun?  I sure think so.  Can you find 4 sentences?  Or perhaps, all 19 words?
    ["Let's write RegEx", "  Won't that be fun", '  I sure think so', '  Can you find 4 sentences', '  Or perhaps, all 19 words', '']

    ['4', '19']
