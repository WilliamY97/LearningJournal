# Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Support Vector Machines (aka Support Vector Networks) are a type of supervised learning model used for classification and regression analysis.

Simply speaking, the SVM model is a representation of the data as points in space, seperated by a gap that is as wide as possible. New
examples can then be added to the space and predicted to belong to a category based on which side of the gap they fall on.

*Support Vector Machines are an optimization problem. They are attempting to find a hyperplane that divides the two classes with the largest margin. The support vectors are the points which fall within this margin. It's easiest to understand if you build it up from simple to more complex.*
