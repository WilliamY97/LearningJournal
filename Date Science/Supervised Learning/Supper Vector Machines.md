# Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Support Vector Machines (aka Support Vector Networks) are a type of supervised learning model used for classification and regression analysis.

Simply speaking, the SVM model is a representation of the data as points in space, seperated by a gap that is as wide as possible. New
examples can then be added to the space and predicted to belong to a category based on which side of the gap they fall on.
