# Naive Bayes

Naive Bayes is a classification technique based on Bayes' Theorem with an assumption of independence amongst predictors. In simple terms,
a Naive Bayes classifier assumes that the presence of a particular feature in a class is unrelated to any other feature.

Ex.

*a fruit may be considered to be an apple if it is red, round, and about 3 inches in diameter. Even if these features depend on each other or upon the existence of the other features, all of these properties independently contribute to the probability that this fruit is an apple and that is why it is known as ‘Naive’.*

Simply speaking, the SVM model is a representation of the data as points in space, seperated by a gap that is as wide as possible. New
examples can then be added to the space and predicted to belong to a category based on which side of the gap they fall on.
