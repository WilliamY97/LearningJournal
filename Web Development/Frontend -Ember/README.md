# Ember.js

## What is Ember?

Ember is a client-side MVC framework. It helps to create reusable and extendable code by seperating and isolating
responsibilities.

Today, most web applications send data to the servers to validate, process, and render html. Frameworks like Ember
are shifting responsibilities from the serer to the web browser.

Ember packages all build tools and packages into one place which gives you benefits from the entire Javascript community.

## Installing Ember

1. Ensure Node.js is installed and npm is available
2. Install Ember CLI using npm ```npm install -g ember-cli```
3. Ember new <project-name>
