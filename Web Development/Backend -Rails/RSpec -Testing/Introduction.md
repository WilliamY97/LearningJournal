# Introduction

- Popular Ruby testing framework
- Less Ruby-like, natural syntax
- Domain Specific Language for testing - Added additional language features on top of Ruby
- Well-formatted output

RSpec evolved from Behaviour Driven Development

## Installing RSpec

1. ```gem install respec```
2. rspec --init (Initialize two files spec_helper and rspec)

We will be building an object in /lib/object.rb

In Rspec we substitute test with specification.

We put our specifications in the /spec/ directory

### ```spec/lib/zombie_spec.rb```

```require "spec_helper"```
